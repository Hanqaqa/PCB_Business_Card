# PCB Business Card

In this repository I will explain the steps I followed to create this Business Card made out of PCB material inspired by [Chris Tully's card from Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/cast4)

There are more pictures on the Media folder.

I have used 3 Open Source Programs in total:

* [KiCad v5.1.6](https://www.kicad.org/) <- I have also tried up to version 8.0.1 and it still works!
* [Inkscape v1.0.0](https://inkscape.org/) <- I have tried up to version 1.3.2 and it still works!
* [Svg2Shenzen v0.2.18.7](https://github.com/badgeek/svg2shenzhen) <- The project is discontinued but it still works!

The instructions are very easy and clear on how to install each program.

## Creating the Canvas in Inkscape

Once the extension has been added in Inkscape. Go to Extension > Svg2Shenzhen > Prepare Document and create a 100 x 100 mm document and click Apply.

Start creating your design by layers. Keep in mind how **Unexposed Copper**, **Exposed Copper**, **SilkScreen** and **Naked FR4** look like. Try to play with those combinations. [This video by TwinkleTwinkie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbkvza8cKQE) gives a good tutorial on how the whole proccess works. He also shows a good overview of the color palette you will have:

After fiddling with Inkscape for a couple of hours (The GUI isn't that intuitive and I wasn't particularly inspired) I ended up with these layers:

Disclaimer: ~~I couldn't get to work the edge.cuts layer in Inkscape ([Same problem as him](https://github.com/badgeek/svg2shenzhen/issues/119)), so since it was a simple 85.6x54 mm card with edges of 2.5 mm radius. I easily drew them in KiCad in the Edge.Cuts Layer.~~ In order to get the edge.cuts layer to work when you export to KiCad in the Svg2Shenzen extension. Tick the Flatten Bezier option.

## Sending the File

Once I had everything finished. I prepared my Gerber files in KiCad, packed them inside a rar and ordered them to JLCPCB with standard 0.8mm thickness and everything else with default settings: HASL with lead (Next batch will be done lead free, since it is safer for humans and the enviorenment, and the price only increases about 10 cents per card), FR4 base, black PCB Color... 10 of them cost me $4 + $20 shipping ($2.40 a card), so a bit expensive for my taste. 

In this repository you can find the [SVG file](https://github.com/Hanqaqa/PCB_Business_Card/blob/master/drawing.svg) I made in Inkscape, as well as the [Gerber files](https://github.com/Hanqaqa/PCB_Business_Card/blob/master/Gerbers/Gerbers.rar) I made in KiCad and sent to JLCPCB. 

## Youtube Video

After quite a few requests from people telling me to help them with their PCB Business Cards, I decided to create my own Youtube tutorial! Enjoy it!
